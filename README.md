# 3-Body_Problem_Analysis

## Overview
This program runs multiple simulations of the three-body problem with varying initial conditions. For each variation,the trajectories of the three bodies are stored, allowing  the user to animate each simulation using matplotlib's animation module. Utilising Pandas, data analysis is then performed (calculating the mean path, variance and deviation), along with a statistical summary (mean and standard deviation) to compare the trajectories across all simulations.
